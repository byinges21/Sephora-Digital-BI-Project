# Interview Talk Track

"I built a digital BI case study aligned to Sephora's desktop, mobile web, and app ecosystem. I used SQL to diagnose funnel leakage, quantified personalization impact, and translated findings into a practical optimization roadmap for Product, Marketing, and Merchandising stakeholders."

## Likely interviewer questions
- How did you validate data?
- Which KPI did you optimize first and why?
- How would you productionize this model and dashboard?

# Interview Talk Track

## How to Introduce the Project
"I built a digital BI case study modeled after a beauty ecommerce environment with desktop, mobile web, and app channels. I used SQL to diagnose funnel performance, quantified personalization impact, and translated findings into prioritized product and merchandising recommendations."

## Methods to Highlight
- KPI framework: sessions, conversion, AOV, revenue per session
- Funnel diagnostics: view -> cart -> checkout -> order
- Segmentation: channel, traffic source, campaign, personalization exposure
- Stakeholder framing: technical deep-dive + executive summary

## What Makes This Relevant to Sephora
- Mirrors omnichannel digital measurement priorities
- Connects analytics to product and client experience decisions
- Demonstrates communication across product, merchandising, and marketing

## Likely Q&A and Good Answers
1. "How did you validate data quality?"
   - I reconciled stage totals, checked null/duplicate keys, and ensured conversion math was consistent across views.
2. "How would you productionize this?"
   - Build reusable SQL models, schedule refreshes, add monitoring for metric anomalies, and document metric definitions.
3. "What would you do in your first 30 days?"
   - Align KPI definitions with stakeholders, audit tracking implementation, and launch one high-confidence funnel optimization test.

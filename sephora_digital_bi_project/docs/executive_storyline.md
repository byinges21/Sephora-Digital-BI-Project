# Executive Storyline (5-7 Minutes)

## 1) Objective
Evaluate digital channel performance and identify where to focus next-quarter optimization for conversion and revenue growth.

## 2) What the Data Shows
- The app has the strongest conversion efficiency and highest revenue per session.
- Mobile web has the largest funnel drop-off from product view to checkout.
- Personalized experiences outperform non-personalized experiences on conversion and revenue per session.

## 3) Business Implications
- The biggest near-term upside is reducing friction in mobile web checkout.
- Personalization investment appears justified and should be expanded, especially where traffic is high but conversion is weaker.
- Marketing-source quality varies by channel; paid social and paid search should be monitored with tighter landing page and onsite journey alignment.

## 4) Recommended Actions
1. Launch a mobile web checkout simplification test (shipping form reduction, express pay prominence).
2. Expand personalization coverage to additional product categories and high-traffic entry pages.
3. Establish weekly channel-source performance review with clear guardrails and owner accountability.

## 5) KPI Targets (Example)
- +80 bps mobile web session-to-order rate
- +10% mobile web revenue per session
- +5% app revenue per session via expanded personalization
